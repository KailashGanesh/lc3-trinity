## what I learned:
- when I first started this, I have no clue what registers referes to, what op codes are; even though I have used a shift register + 556 timer to make a LED chaser in the past
- I watched [Ben Easter's Programming my 8-bit breadboard computer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PPrrSyubG0) and every thing makes sense now - even though his CPU is SAP-1 based; seeing physical regestors and manually programming the computer made the concepts click.
